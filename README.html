<p>asbt is a tool for managing packages in your local copy of slackbuilds,
which can be obtained from http://slackbuilds.org/ (SBo), 
for Slackware Linux.</p>

<p>It supports following functions/options:</p>

<ol>
<li>search the repository (-s)</li>
<li>info about specified package (-i)</li>
<li>readme about specified package (-r)</li>
<li>goto the package directory (-g)</li>
<li>view slackbuild (-v)</li>
<li>list files contained in specified package directory (-l,-L)</li>
<li>description about specified package (-d)</li>
<li>get / download the package (-G)</li>
<li>build the package (-B)</li>
<li>install the built package (-I)</li>
<li>details about installed package (-D)</li>
<li>upgrade installed package with built package (-U)</li>
<li>remove installed package (-R)</li>
<li>query installed packages (-q)</li>
<li>view all packages installed from SBo (-q --sbo)</li>
<li>update the local git repo of slackbuilds (-u)</li>
<li>check for upgrades to installed packages (-c)</li>
<li>view the ChangeLog.txt from the local copy of the slackbuilds repo (-C)</li>
<li>track the source and built package for specified package (-t) </li>
<li>enlist all packages which have given package in their .info file (-e)</li>
<li>tidy the source and package directories by removing old entries (-T)</li>
</ol>

<p>It uses the following Slackware tools:</p>

<ol>
<li>installpkg</li>
<li>upgradepkg</li>
<li>removepkg</li>
</ol>

<h1>Ideology:</h1>

<p>asbt runs as a normal application, and aids in package management of SBo packages by
displaying information about the packages, getting and building them,
checking updates to the packages, and viewing details about the installed packages, etc.</p>

<p>When root access is required, for example, when installing or removing packages,
sudo is used to gain the root privelege. This ensures demarcation between
informational activites like searching or viewing information, and activites which
change the system state, like installing or removing packages.</p>

<p>asbt is designed with simplicity in mind; 
some complex cases are not handled and are left to the user's discretion.
Rather, it aids and automates functions like searching for packages, downloading the source, building the packages,
and installing / upgading them, while following rules like where to store these source and built packages,
and displays information about the process in a transparent way, 
without trying to hinder the user with excess verbiage.</p>

<p>The variables used are:</p>

<pre>
1) repodir=""
 # Repository for slackbuilds.

2) srcdir=""
 # Where the downloaded source packages are to be placed.
 # Leave it blank for saving it in the same directory as the slackbuild.

3) outdir=""
 # Where the build package will be placed. 
 # Leave it blank for putting it in /tmp.

4) gitdir=""
 # Directory where the slackbuilds git repository is present.

5) editor="" 
 # Editor for viewing/editing slackbuilds.

6) buildflags=""
 # Build flags specified while building a package
</pre>

<p>Samples for these variables are present in the script itself.</p>

<p>These can be overrided by specifying the options provided in the configuration file "/etc/asbt/asbt.conf"</p>

<h1>Installation:</h1>

<p>Via SBo,
http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.1/system/asbt/</p>

<p>Or, (as root)
make install</p>

<h1>Post Installation:</h1>

<p>asbt can be setup using the command:</p>

<p>asbt -S</p>

<p>This checks if the slackbuilds repository is present, and is not empty.
If it is empty, it prompts to set it up by cloning the slackbuilds.org git repository.</p>

<p>Further it asks to set the variables in the configuration file /etc/asbt/asbt.conf</p>

<h1>Usage:</h1>

<p>asbt &lt;option&gt; [package]</p>

<h1>Examples:</h1>

<pre>
asbt -s dosbox  # search for package dosbox
asbt -i dosbox  # read the info file for dosbox
asbt -v dosbox  # view / edit slackbuild
asbt -G dosbox  # get (download) dosbox (source)
asbt -B dosbox  # build package for dosbox
asbt -I dosbox  # install built package
asbt -I dosbox-0.74  # install specified version of built package
asbt -D dosbox  # view details about installed package dosbox
asbt -q dosbox  # query whether dosbox is installed
asbt -q --sbo  # query all SBo intalled packages
asbt -q --all  # query all installed packages
asbt -c  # check for updates to packages installed from the repo
asbt -c all # check all installed packages for updates to packages from the repo
</pre>

<h1>Notes:</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>When searching, a *(wildcard) at both ends is implied.</p>

<p>For example, if one wants to search for all packages which have the word "xfce", one can use <code>asbt search xfce</code>
instead of <code>asbt search '*xfce*'</code></p></li>
<li><p>When querying, if the package(s) is/are installed, they will they displayed,
else no output. A *(wildcard) at both ends is also implied when querying.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose that you want to install a built package virtualbox-kernel (asbt install virtualbox-kernel), and you get something like:</p>

<p>Installing virtualbox-kernel
/usr/bin/asbt: line 135: [: /home/aaditya/packages/virtualbox-kernel-4.3.4<em>3.10.17-x86</em>64-1_SBo.tgz: binary operator expected
N/A</p>

<p>This could be because there are 2 packages virtualbox-kernel, while it can process only one.
In such a case, expand the name of package to install, so that it can differentiate between the package versions, eg, </p>

<p>asbt install virtualbox-kernel-4.3.4_3.10.28</p></li>
<li><p>Giving package path instead of package supports installation of package from custom folder. For example,</p>

<p>asbt -B ~/builds/thermal<em>daemon/thermal</em>daemon-1.1</p>

<p>Here the above path is the folder which contains the source and slackbuild and related files.</p></li>
<li><p>While building packages, options can also be passed. For example,</p>

<p>asbt -B volumeicon NOTIFY=yes</p>

<p>These build options are different for every package, and can be found out by reading the package's README or Slackbuild.</p></li>
<li><p>Build flags in the config file are passed to each package while building. </p>

<p>The default flags that are specified are: "MAKEFLAGS=-j2" (means use 2 CPU cores while building).</p>

<p>However, some packages can fail to build on multiple cores (for example, webkitgtk).</p>

<p>For such packages, while building, the buildargs can be overrided. For example,</p>

<p>asbt -B webkitgtk MAKEFLAGS=-j1</p></li>
<li><p>asbt modifies the CWD=$(pwd) line in a slackbuild to CWD=${CWD:-$(pwd)} so that it can build from any location by specifying the build location.
This change is reverted after building the package.</p>

<p>But if for some reason the build process was interrupted/failed, or any changes were manually made to the files, then the slackbuild would be changed, and git may complain about this change when updating the git repo.</p>

<p>To work around this issue, first the current git state is stashed with git stash save, and then the repo is updated.
To know more about git stash, read the git-stash man page.</p></li>
<li><p>If you use other tools like sbopkg (http://sbopkg.org/) to synchronise your git repository, and if these tools are meant to be run as root (like sbopkg), then they can change ownership of the slackbuilds git repository, and you can get messages like:</p>

<p>chmod: changing permissions of /home/aaditya/slackbuilds/desktop/screenfetch/screenfetch.SlackBuild: Operation not permitted
Enter your password to take ownership of the slackbuild.</p>

<p>In such a case, one change ownership of the slackbuilds repository using the chown command. For example,</p>

<p>sudo chown -R $USER /home/$USER/slackbuilds</p></li>
<li><p>Using the -T (tidy) option, one can clean one's src or pkg directories of old items. It retains the latest 3 entries by date.</p>

<p>The --dry-run option can be used to see which entries are going to be deleted. For example,</p>

<p>asbt -T --dry-run pkg</p></li>
<li><p>Since version 0.9.5, multiple packages can be specified for some options, like get (-G), install (-I), upgrade (-U), remove (-R), and process (-P). For example,</p>

<p>asbt -P i3 i3status</p>

<p>The packages are processed in the order they are specified.</p>

<p>However, multiple packages cannot be specified for the build (-B) option, since the build option takes the extra arguments as build arguments for that package.</p></li>
</ul>
