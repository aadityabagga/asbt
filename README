asbt is a tool for managing packages in your local copy of slackbuilds,
usually obtained from http://slackbuilds.org/ (SBo), for Slackware Linux.

It supports following functions/options:

1)  search the repository (-s)
2)  info about specified package (-i)
3)  readme about specified package (-r)
4)  goto the package directory (-g)
5)  view slackbuild (-v)
6)  list files contained in specified package directory (-l)
7)  description about specified package (-d)
8)  get/download the package (-G)
9)  build the package (-B)
10) install the built package (-I)
11) upgrade installed package with built package (-U)
12) remove installed package (-R)
13) query installed packages (-q)
14) view all packages installed from the slackbuilds repo (-a)
15) update the local git repo of slackbuilds (-u)
16) check for upgrades to installed packages (-c)

It uses the following (Slackware) tools:

1) installpkg
2) removepkg
3) upgradepkg

The variables used are:

1) repodir=""
 # Repository for slackbuilds.

2) srcdir=""
 # Where the downloaded source packages are to be placed.
 # Leave it blank for saving it in the same directory as the slackbuild.

3) outdir=""
 # Where the build package will be placed. 
 # Leave it blank for putting it in /tmp.

4) gitdir=""
 # Directory where the slackbuilds git repository is present.

5) editor="" 
 # Editor for viewing/editing slackbuilds.

Samples for these variables are present in the script itself.

These can be overrided by specifying the options provided in the configuration file "/etc/asbt/asbt.conf".

Installation:
Via SBo,
http://slackbuilds.org/repository/14.1/system/asbt/

or, (as root)
make install

Usage:
asbt <option> [package]

Examples:
asbt -s dosbox (search for package dosbox)
asbt -i dosbox (read the info file for dosbox)
asbt -v dosbox (view/edit slackbuild)
asbt -G dosbox (get(download) dosbox(source))
asbt -B dosbox (build package for dosbox)
asbt -I dosbox (install built package)
asbt -I dosbox-0.74 (install specified version of built package)
asbt -a (list all packages installed from the slackbuilds repository)
asbt -c (check for updates to packages installed from the slackbuild repository)

Note:
1) When searching, a *(wildcard) at both ends is implied.

For example, if one wants to search for all packages which have the word "xfce", one can use-
asbt search xfce

Instead of-
asbt search '*xfce*'

2) When querying, if the package(s) is/are installed, they will they displayed,
else no output. A *(wildcard) at both ends is also implied when querying.

3) Suppose that you want to install a built package virtualbox-kernel (asbt install virtualbox-kernel),
and you get something like:

Installing virtualbox-kernel
/usr/bin/asbt: line 135: [: /home/aaditya/packages/virtualbox-kernel-4.3.4_3.10.17-x86_64-1_SBo.tgz: binary operator expected
N/A

This could be because there are 2 packages virtualbox-kernel, while it can process only one.
In such a case, expand the name of package to install, so that it can differentiate between the package versions, eg, 
asbt upgrade virtualbox-kernel-4.3.4_3.10.28

4) Giving package path instead of package supports installation of package from custom folder. For example,
asbt -B ~/builds/thermald/thermal_daemon-1.1

Here the above path is the folder which contains the source and slackbuild and related files.

Bugs:
1) asbt modifies the CWD=$(pwd) line in the slackbuild to CWD=${CWD:-$(pwd)} so that it can build from any location by specifying the build location.
	This change is reverted after building the package.
But if someone interrupted the build process, then the slackbuild wont be reverted, and git may complain about this change when updating the git repo of slackbuilds.
